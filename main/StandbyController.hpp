* \class StandbyController
*
* \brief Class that controlls the devices sleepmodes
*
* This class will take care of every sleep and reset condition.
* Currently the system knows the following:
*  - Reset when the device gets taken of the charger;
*  - Sleep until a pin interrupt when SD card is removed;
*  - Sleep SLEEP_TIME_SEC after TIMEOUT_TIME_SEC with no movement.
*
* If one of the states requests a deep sleep, bits for all running tasks
* (WiFi, Sensor & SDWriter) will be set. Every task will go
* into a ready to sleep routine and reset these bits. This task will notice
* all three bits have been reset and will enable the ESP32's deep sleep.
