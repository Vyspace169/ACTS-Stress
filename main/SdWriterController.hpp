*
* \brief Task that handles writing to SD-Card
*
* This task will write all data to the SDCard when one of the
* DoubleBuffers is full. When this happens a bit will be set and
* this task will open, write and close the used file. The filename
* is set in the main loop.
*
* If the sleepbit has been set this task will go into an infinite loop.
